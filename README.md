Mathematics for Misfits is a book of math problems about 'taboo' subjects.  The book is available through the bookstores listed in the linktree profile link below.

The book was written entirely in [LaTeX](https://github.com/latex3/), except the front/back cover.  I am porting it to an accessible friendly e-book, and created the [Accessible Mathematics](https://github.com/mathematicsformisfits/accessiblemath) project page to catalog the tools I've discovered.
